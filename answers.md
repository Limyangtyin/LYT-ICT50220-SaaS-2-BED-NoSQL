# How to Answer Questions

Each time you answer a question, fill out the space provided for the answer to the question.

```text
## Question X - Title

Query Solution:

```js
	db.collection_name.find();
	```
```

The NoSQL code used to answer the question is contained in a code block, as shown above. 

It is important that code blocks start at the beginning of the line for formatting on GitHub, Obsidian or your preferred IDE render the code correctly.

Images are embedded using the following syntax:

```markdown
![Short Image Title](./folder/filename.extension)
```

For example:

```markdown
![Embedding an Image Example](./assets/step-N-XXX.png)
```

Gives:

![Embedding an Image Example](assets/step-N-XXX.png)


# Step 2: NoSQL Systems

## 2.1 Identify Data Types

| Item         | Data Type     |
|--------------|---------------|
| id           | ObjectId      |
| title        | string        |
| year         | integer       |
| writer       | array(string) | 
| summary      | string        | 
| franchise    | string        | 
| running time | integer       |
| budget       | integer       |
| box office   | double        | 



# Step 3: NoSQL Databases & Collections

## 3.1 Connecting

- Connect to a running instance of MongoDB (this may be local or in the cloud).

Connection String:

```js
	mongodb://localhost:27017
```
	
### 3.2 Database Creation

- Create and use a database named `saas_bed_portfolio_2024s2`.

Query Solution:

```js
	use saas_bed_portfolio_2024s2
```

### 3.3 Collection Creation

- Create a new collection named movies and insert ...

Query Solution:

```js
	db.createCollection('movies')
    db.movies.insertOne({Title: 'Fight Club', Writer: 'Chuck Palahniuk', Year: 1999, Actors: ['Brad Pitt', 'Edward Norton']})
```

```js
	db.movies.aggregate([
  {
$group: {
_id: "$Franchise",
movieCount: {$sum: 1}}}]);
```

# Step 11: Triggers

Using the movies collection, we are now going to create triggers to provide an audit trail for when data is added, updated or deleted.

## 11.1 Create trigger for inserted data

- Create a trigger that monitors the movies collection for new data being added. 

Query Solution:

```js
const changeStream = db.movies.watch([
  { $match: { operationType: "insert" } }
]);

print("Watching for new movies...");

while (changeStream.hasNext()) {
  const change = changeStream.next();
  const newMovie = change.fullDocument;

  db.movie_audit.insertOne({
    action: "INSERT",                          
    action_date: new Date(),                   
    original_data: newMovie                    
  });

  print(`Logged new movie: ${newMovie.Title}`);
}
```

![NoSQL Databases & Collection](./images/step-11.1-001.png)
![NoSQL Databases & Collection](./images/step-11.1-002.png)

## 11.2 Testing the insert trigger works correctly

- Use the following data to check the trigger functions as expected:

Query Solution:

```js
	insertLog({
Title: "Jeffrey",
Writer: "Paul Rudnick",
Year: 1995,
Actors: ["Sigourney Weaver", "Patrick Stewart", "Michael T.Weiss", "Steven Weber", "Bryan Batt"],
BoxOffice: 3500000,
RunningTime: 92}
);
```

![NoSQL Databases & Collection](./images/step-11.2-001.png)

## 11.3 Create trigger for updated data

- Create a trigger that monitors the movies collection for new data being added. 

Query Solution:

```js
const changeStream = db.movies.watch([{
  $match: { operationType: "update" }
}]);

print("Watching for movie updates...");

while (changeStream.hasNext()) {
  const change = changeStream.next();
  const originalData = db.movies.findOne({ _id: change.documentKey._id }); 
  const updatedData = change.fullDocument; 
  
  db.movie_audit.insertOne({
    action: "UPDATE",
    action_date: new Date(),
    original_data: originalData,
    data: updatedData
  });

  print(`Logged update for movie: ${updatedData.title}`);
}
```

Screen Shot:

![NoSQL Databases & Collection](./images/step-11.3-001.png)

## 11.4 Testing the update trigger works correctly

- Use the following data to verify that the trigger functions as expected. Make sure that these updates are completed in more than one query:

Query Solution:

```js
db.movies.updateOne(
  { Title: "Avatar" },
  { 
    $set: { 
      Budget: 23700000,
			RunningTime: 162,
			BoxOffice: 2923000000,
      Franchise: "Avatar" 
    } 
  }
);

db.movies.updateOne(
  { Title: "Avatar" },
  { 
    $addToSet: {  
      Actors: { 
        $each: [  
          "Sam Worthington", 
          "Zoe Saldana", 
          "Stephen Lang", 
          "Michelle Rodriguez", 
          "Sigourney Weaver"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
);
```

## 11.5 Create trigger for deleted data

- Create a trigger that monitors the movies collection for new data being added. 

Query Solution:

```js
const changeStream = db.movies.watch([
  { $match: { operationType: "delete" } }
]);

print("Watching for movie deletions...");

while (changeStream.hasNext()) {
  const change = changeStream.next();
  
  const deletedMovieId = change.documentKey._id;

  db.movie_audit.insertOne({
    action: "DELETE",
    action_date: new Date(),
    original_data: { _id: deletedMovieId }
  });

  print(`Logged delete for movie with ID: ${deletedMovieId}`);
}
```

![NoSQL Databases & Collection](./images/step-11.5-001.png)


## 11.6 Testing the delete trigger works correctly

- Use the following conditions to verify that the trigger functions as expected:

Query Solution:

```js
db.movies.deleteOne({ Title: /Dummy/i });
```

![NoSQL Databases & Collection](./images/step-11.6-001.png)


## 11.7 Verify the log contains data…

- Write a query to show the data in the movie audit log.

Query Solution:

```js
	db.movie_audit.find().pretty();
```
